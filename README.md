Repo for the submission of the course project for the  Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by John Hopkins.

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)



### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### Scripts
#### Downloading the data
Use projectdata.R to download and unzip dataset  into "data" directory 

#### Assignment tasks
The script run_analysis.R performs all the assignment tasks.



### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
